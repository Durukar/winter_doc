# Why Drizzle as Our ORM

**Don't judge a book by its cover**

---

At WinterFramework, we prioritize simplicity and efficiency, aiming to keep dependencies to a minimum. After careful consideration, we selected **Drizzle** as our official ORM. While we explored **Prisma** as a strong contender, its challenges with cloud deployments and noticeable performance overhead led us to favor Drizzle. This decision reflects our commitment to delivering a fast, lightweight, and seamless development experience for your projects.
