# It's So Cold ❄️

**Just for the curious**

---

Many years ago, I was a Java developer using the **SpringBoot** environment, and I was always amazed by the *simplicity* and *efficiency* of setting up a Spring server. I had never experienced anything quite like it when I transitioned to the JavaScript environment.  

Even though I used various frameworks like **NestJS**, **Fastify**, and even **Hono** itself, I never found it as straightforward to implement a server. I always ended up spending a lot of time on *configuration processes* rather than *coding processes*.  

With that in mind, I created **WinterFramework** (initially as a playful experiment) to simplify the process of building the backend of an application.
