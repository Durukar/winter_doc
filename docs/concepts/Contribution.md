## Always Open, Always Together ❄️
To everyone who loves the cold ❄️

The **WinterFramework** was born with a special promise in its heart: to be *always open source*. We believe that code is more beautiful when shared, and our project is a little home with wide-open doors for the community. We want to warm up the development world with collaboration and brilliant ideas!  

Contributions are *super welcome*! Whether you’re a curious soul, a seasoned dev, or someone eager to leave your mark, feel invited to join this frosty adventure. Together, we can build something amazing—one line of code at a time.
