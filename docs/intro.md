# First Steps

Let's discover **WinterFramework in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new restAPI**.

<!-- Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**. -->

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 22.0LTS or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) version 1.2 or above:
  - When installing Bun, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new API

<!-- Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**. -->

Download the latest release of the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Durukar/WinterFramework
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

After downloading, navigate to the `backend` folder and run the dependency installation command:

```bash
bun i or bun install
```

## Start your API

Run the server:

```bash
bun start
```

Your server run in `http://localhost:1337/`

> **⚠️** Prod port is `8080` dev port is `1337`

## FINALY

Done! You now have a REST server and can start implementing controllers, services, and everything a good REST API can offer you.

<!-- The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there. -->

<!-- The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/. -->

<!-- Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes. -->
